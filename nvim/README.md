# About

These are simply my Neovim dotfiles. I will assume that if you are interested enough to have found or asked for my Neovim dotfiles, you will know how to use them, so I won't cover that.

# Dependencies 

The necessary dependencies for these dotfiles are the following:

- `fzf` (fuzzy finder, general purpose)
- `nodejs` (for the Markdown preview plugin)
- `yarn` (also for the Markdown preview plugin)
- `npm` (to install LSPs)
- `xdg-utils` (also for the Markdown preview plugin)
- `texlive` and `texlive-binextra` (for VimTeX)
- `xclip` (so that the clipboard functions properly)
- `jupytext` (for Jupyter notebooks)

And probably some others that I have missed.
