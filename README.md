# About

This repository contains my personal configuration for development on Linux.

Feel free to copy anything you see here, as it has most likely already been copied from elsewhere. However, I do not recommend copying everything directly unless you know what you are doing.

# Dependencies

These are probably incomplete, but it should include some stuff. It may also include things that aren't necessarily dependencies.

- `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
- `ttf-jetbrains-mono` and `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd`
- `xsecurelock`
- `scrot`
- `wmname`
- `lightdm`
- `lightdm-webkit2-greeter`
- `lightdm-webkit-theme-litarvan`
- `pavucontrol`

Please note that `lightdm` needs to be configured properly before use; see [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LightDM).
